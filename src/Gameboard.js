// place ships at specific coordinates by calling ```Ship```
// have a ```receiveAttack function``` that takes a pair of coordinates, determines whether or not the attack hit a ship and then sends the ‘hit’ function to the correct ship, or records the coordinates of the missed shot.
// Gameboards should keep track of missed attacks so they can display them properly.
// Gameboards should be able to report whether or not all of their ships have been sunk.
