# Battleship
A single player battleship game where the player tries to sink all of the oponent's ships(implemented AI)
[Live Demo](https://lemuellin.github.io/odin-battleship/)

# Summary
1. Test Driven Development
    - Practice implementing the logic of the game using Jest and did not have to rely on creating a UI or making many console.log statements.
2. Factories and Modules
    - By separating functions to different factories and module patterns helps cleaning up the code.

# Future Development:
1. Implement Drag and Drop API.
2. Polish the AI by judging the orientation of the 'already hit spots', and take more logical hits. The current AI only hit the spots around the 'hit but not sunk' spots without judging the orientation of the ship.
