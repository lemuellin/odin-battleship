# Battleship
A single player battleship game where the player tries to sink all of the oponent's ships
[Live Demo](https://lemuellin.github.io/odin-battleship/)

# Summary
1. Test Driven Development
    I got to practice implementing the logic of the game using Jest and did not have to rely on creating a UI or making many console.log statements.
2. Factories and Modules
    By separating functions to different factories and module patterns helps cleaning up the code.

# Future Development:
1. Implement Drag and Drop API.
2. Polish the AI by having it try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.
3. Mobile Friendly
